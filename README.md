## About

**Guess the Flag** is a simple trivia game built with SwiftUI that tests your knowledge of world flags — one tap at a time.

You’re shown a country name and given three flag options. Pick the correct one, rack up points, and see how many you can get right out of 8 rounds. Get it wrong? Lose a point and get called out with the name of the country you tapped instead.

### Features

- 🌍 12 shuffled country flags
- 🧠 8-question gameplay loop
- 🎨 Gradient background and modern SwiftUI UI
- ⚡ Instant feedback with alerts
- 📱 Built entirely with native SwiftUI — no dependencies
